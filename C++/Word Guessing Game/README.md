Command-line Guessing Game
Plays like hangman, except that the number of guesses is based on the length of the word
Rather than a set number of guesses

Difficulty:
Seperated into 2 sections: Word List and Guessing
  >Word List:
    This determines the difficulty of the set of words used in the guessing game.
    Currently 3 difficulties: Easy, Normal & Hard
  >Guessing:
    This determines how many chances to incorrectly guess are available.
    Currently 2 difficulties: Easy (multiple guesses) & Hard (1 Guess)


Future Plans:
Implement a GUI rather than keep it as command-line.
Implement Categories: Sports, Movies, etc.
Allow the user to create a list of custom words
Potentially make it a hub of different games:
  e.g Guessing Game, Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe, etc.
